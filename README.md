# Introduction - Message Board (Forum) Application RESTful API

In my Web Services Class at Camosun College we were tasked with implementing a RESTful API for a Message Board Application using Node.js and Express.js.
Prior to designing and developing the Web Service, we developed a simple front-end application in React.js.
the Message Board App is a great concept for learning to build an API because we can incorporate all the database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations. 
We will be creating messages, updating them, and deleting them.

Next.js was used for Static Generation pre-rendering. AJAX calls were made using Axios. 
A MongoDB NoSQL database was used purely for the purpose of gaining more experience using Mongo and NoSQL databases.
